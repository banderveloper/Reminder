# Reminder 

An unfinished full stack project about creating mentions using SignalR for live communication.

Access and refresh tokens were transmitted in read-only cookies, but it turned out that the client side of the library does not support the transmission of cookies. There is no desire to remake the system. Started the next project.

I left this project public to share my backend codebase.
